## Overview

**ArrayMaster** is a Java-based console application designed to perform a wide variety of operations on arrays. This project offers functionality for inserting, deleting, updating, sorting, reversing, and analyzing arrays, making it an excellent tool for learning and practicing array manipulation in Java.

## Features

6. **Update All:** Update all elements in the array.
7. **Occurrence:** Count the occurrences of a specific element.
8. **First Occurrence:** Find the position of the first occurrence of an element.
9. **Last Occurrence:** Find the position of the last occurrence of an element.
10. **Sort:** Sort the array in ascending order.
11. **Reverse:** Reverse the order of the elements in the array.
12. **Min:** Find the minimum element in the array.
13. **Max:** Find the maximum element in the array.
14. **Sum:** Calculate the sum of all elements in the array.
15. **Average:** Compute the average value of the array elements.
16. **Display:** Print the current state of the array.
17. **Clear:** Clear the array (make it empty).
18. **Is Empty:** Check if the array is empty.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```

3. **Run the Program:**
   ```bash
   java arrayOperations.Project_Arrays
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the program** and follow the prompts to select the desired operation.
2. **Input the necessary details** as requested by the application (e.g., array elements, positions, etc.).
3. **View the results** of your operation, which will be displayed in the console.

## Example
